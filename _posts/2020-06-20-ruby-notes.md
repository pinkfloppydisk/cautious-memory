Here I am going to keep my Ruby notes that I've found useful and would like to read again in the future with their links to the source.

#### Class Methods

> While some object oriented languages have class structures that support both instance methods and class methods (sometimes called static methods), Ruby only supports instance methods. If Ruby only supports instance methods where do all those class methods you've been creating end up? Why, the **singleton class** of course![^1]
