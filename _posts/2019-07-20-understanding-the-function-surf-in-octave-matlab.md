I've been studying Machine Learning for a few days now, on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/). After finishing 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> weeks, I've got the first assignment for the course where you are supposed to implement Linear Regression using Gradient Descent.

While trying to do the assignment, I've come across with a function, `surf()`, for which I've struggled ~~a few hours~~ a little bit  to understand.

---

What was confusing for me in the assignment was this line below: 
>Because of the way meshgrids work in the `surf()` command, we need to transpose `J_vals` before calling surf, or else the axes will be flipped.
>`J_vals = J_vals';`

I couldn't get that at first glance, so I've started fiddling with the function and plots until a few hours later I've found this explanation from the docs[^1]. 

>If `x` and `y` are vectors, then a typical vertex is `(x(j), y(i), z(i,j))`.
>Thus, columns of z correspond to different x values and rows of z correspond to different y values.

*Take home message: Always check for the docs FIRST.*  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Anyway, to visualize this I've plotted a graph using the code below:

```MATLAB
A = [1 2 3 4 5 6];
B = [7 8 9 10 11 12];
C = magic(6);

% Matrix C:
% 35  1   6   26   19   24
% 3   32  7   21   23   25
% 31  9   2   22   27   20
% 8   28  33  17   10   15
% 30  5   34  12   14   16
% 4   36  29  13   18   11

surf(A, B, C)
```

By the way, I should mention that in the assignment we were assigning the elements of the matrix C (which corresponds to `J_vals` in the snippet below) like:

```MATLAB
% theta0_vals is a 1x100 row vector, which in our case is the matrix A
% theta1_vals is a 1x100 row vector, which in our case is the matrix B
for i = 1:length(theta0_vals)
    for j = 1:length(theta1_vals)
	  t = [theta0_vals(i); theta1_vals(j)];
	  J_vals(i,j) = computeCost(X, y, t);
    end
end
```

In the above code, we are assigning the result of the computation from A<sub>i</sub> and B<sub>j</sub> to C<sub>i,j</sub>.

So you can think of it as C<sub>i,j</sub> = (A<sub>i</sub>, B<sub>j</sub>).

Considering the explanation above, after using `surf(A, B, C)` you might think that `C(A(1), B(3))` which is `C(1,9)` should be equal to C<sub>1,3</sub> which is 6.

But as you can see from the above surface plot, the point `(1, 9)` maps to 31 or you can use `interp2(A, B, C, 1, 9)` which will give you the same result.

Hence, we take the transpose of the matrix C:

`surf(A, B, C')` 

to get :
