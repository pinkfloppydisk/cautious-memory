No, Andr√© Yuhai is not my real name. I am Burak Kaymakci. I've been using the nick `andreyuhai` everywhere for years now, so it got stuck with me. I am trying to use my real name from now on as much as possible as this started to confuse people IRL.

I've been using Ruby for a few years now mostly for scraping purposes and creating my own gems. Nowadays I am learning Elixir and Phoenix framework. I am working as a backend developer. Here I'll usually be posting stuff that I think I might need to remember in the future or some other things that I find interesting.

I am also interested in:
- Inline skating
- Photography
- Video games (of course)
- Foreign languages
